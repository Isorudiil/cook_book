***** COOK BOOK *****

My short-term goal for this app is for it to serve as a replacement for the excel spreadsheet my wife and I use for our recipes.
It is not user-friendly on phones and it does not serve us well in its current form.

I want to create an app that can:
    - store all of our recipes
    - store all of our pantry items

Some of my initial longer-term goals are:
    - reference our recipes and pantry items to get us a list of meals we could make with items we already have on-hand
    - cost of pantry and meals
